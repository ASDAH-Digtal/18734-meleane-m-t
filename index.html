        <h1>What is a Piano?</h1>
        <p>A piano is an acoustic, stringed instrument developed in Italy by maker Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700, in which the strings are struck by wooden sledges that are covered with a gentler material. It is played utilizing a console, which is a column of keys that the entertainer pushes down or hits with the fingers and thumbs of two hands to make the mallets strike the strings.</p>
        <p>Most current pianos have a column of 88 high contrast keys, 52 white keys for the notes of the C significant scale (C,D,E,F,G,An and B) and 36 more limited dark keys, which are raised over the white keys, and set further back on the console. This means that the piano can play 88 unique pitches, going from the most profound bas reach to the most elevated high pitch.</p>
        <p>Pianos normally have around 220-230 strings that are produced using steel and hung very close to create a sound when being struck by the mallets. Each string generally holds around 168 pounds of strain, making the absolute pressure of most standard pianos around 18-20 tons. Be that as it may, the absolute biggest amazing pianos hold up to walloping 30 tons of pressure. This is truly incredible and exactly what makes piano tuning such a specialist, intricate job that can only be done by a professional.</p>
